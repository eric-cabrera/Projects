These are for setup/testing purposes and were developed at inital Kafka proof of concept at Assurity.
They are used when starting and running a standalone worker. 

These files are specified at connector runtime for a single worker at the cmd line. Config updates pushed
to other workers in a cluster via curl will not be applied to this standalone worker.
